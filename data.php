Much better is when their chops are transmuted into pure energy: Brianstorm, Don’t Sit Down ’Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair and View from the Afternoon swerve too fast through their corners and are all the better for it. The drummer Matt Helders, a mere timekeeper during the Tranquility Base material, is transformed into a dynamo; with a spotlight behind him, he becomes a tub-thumping Godzilla on the rear wall."

Biography-shy musicians that bring a retro sensibility to the music of late-1970s, early-’80s roller rinks and B-boys aren’t unusual, from the action-packed exuberance of the Go! Team in the 2000s to the falsetto-streaked brooding of Jungle in the last decade. SAULT, though, were unusually prolific, and they had something to say. With lyrics foregrounding Black identity, June’s UNTITLED (Black Is) seemed like a fitting soundtrack for this summer of collective action against police violence and systemic racism."
